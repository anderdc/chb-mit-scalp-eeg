    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "Following from `feature_extraction.ipynb` I will continue working on one patient, `chb15`, but I will develop a data transformation pipeline to facilitate gathering of ALL `chb15`'s data files. That way I can create a model using all patient's data, and all the features extracted earlier, then select the most informative ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals \n",
    "- Develop a data processing pipeline that is generalizable for all EEG files\n",
    "- Figure out the best way to separate the data for train/test/validation\n",
    "- begin ideation and perhaps implementation of addressing class imbalance in dataset\n",
    "- Train an SVM (perhaps a random forest too?) and analyze its initial performance and weights to gain insight on where useful information lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on determining feature quality\n",
    "  - Accuracy\n",
    "  - ROC-AUC\n",
    "  - Feature importance (tree based models)\n",
    "  - PCA (looking at the eigenvector and matching that to the features)\n",
